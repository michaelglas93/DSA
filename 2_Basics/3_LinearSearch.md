# Algorithms (The A in DSA)

## Introduction

In this section, we will assume that **JavaScript truly has arrays**, but with a limitation:
- The **only accessible property** is `.length`.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ LinearSearch**

Linear Search is the simplest search algorithm, functioning similarly to `.indexOf()`.

#### **Complexity Analysis**
- **Big-O:** \(O(N)\)
- **Worst Case:** The element is either **not in the array** or found at the **last index**.

#### **Kata Practice:**
You can find an implementation of **Linear Search** in the following file:

üìÇ **[LinearSearchList.ts](../kata-machine/src/day1/LinearSearchList.ts)**

This document serves as an introduction to **search algorithms** in JavaScript with a focus on **linear search**. Future sections will cover more advanced search techniques.
